Updating Links
--------------

Instead of updating the markup directly, the "Members Resources" section is generated using data from `data/links.json`.

Here's what a normal link looks like:

```javascript
[
  	{ 
    	"name": "Info",
    	"links": [
    		...
        	{
        		"name": "Wiki",
        		"href": "https://wiki.csh.rit.edu",
        		"icon": "zocial:wikipedia",
        		"popular": true
        	},
        	...
    	]
  	},
  	...
]
```

The "icon" property maps to the icon's class name from [Icons8](https://icons8.github.io/welovesvg/). For example, `material:cloud` will render a cloud icon.

The "popular" property is optional. If included and set to `true`, the link will appear in the Popular section.

Some entries may link to multiple sites. Here's how to add a link with a dropdown:

```javascript
[
  	{ 
    	"name": "Info",
    	"links": [
    		...
        	{ 
		        "name": "Events",
		        "dropdown": [
		            {
		            	"name": "Calendar",
		            	"href": "https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rti648k5hv7j3ae3a3rum8potk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York"
		          	},
		          	{
		            	"name": "XML",
		            	"href": "http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rti648k5hv7j3ae3a3rum8potk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"
		          	},
		          	{
		            	"name": "iCal",
		            	"href": "http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rti648k5hv7j3ae3a3rum8potk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics"
		          	}
		        ],
		        "icon": "material:events",
		        "popular": true
        	...
    	]
  	},
  	...
]
```

Updating Meetings
-----------------

Like links, meetings are generated from the `data/meetings.json` file. A meeting entry looks like this:

```javascript
[
  { 
    "name": "House", 
    "day": "SUN", 
    "time": "7:00" 
  },
  ...
```
